For my python file I have the link I am accessing in a variable called URL.I use requests to get the website and check if the status code is good/equal to 200. If it's not, I try again and if the same error persists I quit the program. I create a while loop to continue no matter what unless there is a keyboard interrupt. I use BeautifulSoup to look for all html tags that are >tr> and then looking for where the class is simpTblRow because when I inspected the page thats where I found the information I was looking for. I create an empty list called query to store all the information I will be looking for. I make a for loop where I have several variables named after the information I am going to be looking for from the webpage. I use the find function for all the variables. I cast the price, change and volume to a float so when sorting them, it will work properly. For volume, I replace the M with '' because it throws an error when trying to cast to a float. I also round it to 2 decimal places as it was also throwin an error. I append all my variables into the query list in key value pairs making a dictionary. I then connect to my database and create a database called Data and a collection inside called Stocks. Then I insert everything in the query dictionary into the collection. I have at the end a print statement showing that I am scraping the web and a time.sleep(180) so it loops every 3 minutes.
For php, I connected to my database using an authorized user that took me far too long to realize how to do. I store the collection into a result variable. I then code some html and create a table where the table headers all lead to a different php file. I created a for loop where it displays all the values for each table header. To sort the information based on the selected header, I copied all the code from 31609560_Problem1.php and changed the result variable to sort the data based on the selected header.
